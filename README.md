> **Automated competitive intelligence monitoring and strategic analysis system that transforms competitor signals into actionable insights**

## üìñ Overview

The Competitive Intelligence Multi-Agent System is an advanced, AI-powered platform that continuously monitors competitor activities across multiple channels and transforms raw data into strategic insights. Instead of manually tracking dozens of sources, this system provides automated, structured intelligence that answers three critical questions:

- **What happened?** - Event detection and classification
- **Why does it matter?** - Strategic context and impact analysis  
- **What should we do?** - Actionable recommendations and strategic guidance

## üöÄ Key Features

- **üîÑ Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking across news, social media, press releases, and more
- **üß† AI-Powered Analysis**: LLM-driven strategic analysis and recommendations
- **üìä Impact Scoring**: Quantitative assessment of competitive threat levels
- **‚ö° Smart Filtering**: Automated deduplication and relevance scoring
- **üìà Trend Analysis**: Pattern recognition and market trend identification
- **üéØ Actionable Insights**: Strategic recommendations with urgency levels
- **üì± Multi-Channel Alerts**: Slack, email, and dashboard notifications
